# Playwright Debugging Skill

## Type
Skill

## Category
Testing

## When to use
Use when browser tests fail, flake, or need meaningful behaviour assertions.

## Research and psychology basis
This asset uses cognitive forcing, checklist discipline, premortem analysis, adversarial review, uncertainty calibration, and evidence-first reporting. The design is intentionally procedural: it slows the agent down at the points where agents and humans tend to overgeneralise from plausible work, anchor on a first answer, or close a task before proof exists. Testing assets use behaviour-first framing: tests must fail for the risk they claim to cover and must not be treated as proof for unrelated UI, security, or release claims. Skills are written as repeatable procedures so the agent has to follow the same evidence path each time instead of improvising a polished answer. See `../RESEARCH-BASIS.md` for the standard and source map.

## Skill owner role
You are a Playwright debugging specialist.

## Skill objective
Diagnose failures using traces, selectors, timing, state, and user-visible behaviour.

## Required inputs
- User request or review objective
- Relevant repository instructions
- Relevant files, docs, tests, scripts, screenshots, or runtime observations
- Any declared acceptance criteria or constraints
- Known limitations, blocked tools, or unavailable environments

## Skill operating procedure
1. Restate the requested outcome in one sentence and separate it from any inferred goal.
2. Read repository instructions, existing contracts, and relevant examples before proposing action.
3. Map the affected files, UI surfaces, data paths, scripts, docs, and review gates before editing.
4. List assumptions as confirmed, inferred, or unknown, and do not build final claims on unknowns.
5. Define the evidence ladder before work begins: source evidence, behavioural evidence, command evidence, and remaining manual evidence.
6. Use a premortem: assume the change failed after review and name the three most likely causes.
7. Use adversarial review: actively search for facts that would make the preferred solution wrong.
8. Prefer the smallest safe change that satisfies the requirement and preserves surrounding behaviour.
9. Define the behaviour under test in user or system terms before selecting the test type.
10. Prefer tests that fail for the bug or requirement, not tests that merely exercise the new code path.
11. Cover happy path, negative path, boundary path, permission path, and regression path when relevant.
12. Avoid over-mocking the exact behaviour that needs confidence.
13. Use stable selectors and accessible locators for UI tests wherever practical.
14. Check whether the test would catch a wrong implementation or only confirm rendering existence.
15. Separate unit, integration, end-to-end, accessibility, and manual checks in the report.
16. Investigate flakes by isolating timing, state leakage, environment differences, and order dependence.
17. Report skipped tests with reasons and risk impact.
18. Do not update snapshots or assertions unless the changed expectation is justified by the requirement.
19. Include command output and failure traces for reproducibility.
20. Treat missing tests as a known limitation, not as evidence of success.
21. Produce a repeatable procedure for playwright debugging rather than a one-off answer.
22. Define required inputs, optional inputs, and missing-input handling before execution.
23. Make the handoff useful to a different agent or human reviewer.
24. Include a stop condition for uncertainty that would make continued work unsafe.
25. Cite concrete file paths, function names, selectors, routes, screenshots, or command output for every important claim.
26. Mark any untested behaviour as not verified even when the implementation looks plausible.
27. Treat passing tests as one evidence source, not as proof that UI, accessibility, security, or documentation are correct.
28. State what could not be inspected and why, including missing tools, missing environment, inaccessible runtime, or absent user data.
29. Compare the final result against the original request line by line before producing the handoff.
30. Name the remaining risks that would matter to a maintainer, user, auditor, reviewer, or release owner.
31. Return a concise execution summary before the detailed evidence table.
32. List files changed with one reason per file.
33. List files inspected but not changed when they materially influenced the answer.
34. Report commands run exactly as executed and include pass, fail, skipped, or unavailable results.
35. Include a failure-disclosure section even when the outcome is strong.
36. End with one final status value and do not add marketing language after it.

## Deliverables
- A bounded task or review objective.
- An inspected-input list with missing inputs called out.
- A step-by-step execution trace that another agent can reproduce.
- An evidence summary with sources, commands, and manual checks separated.
- A limitation list using the status vocabulary: verified, partially verified, not verified, blocked.
- A next-safe-action recommendation that does not overclaim completion.

## Failure modes this skill is designed to prevent
- Treating a confident answer as evidence.
- Skipping repository instructions because the task feels simple.
- Collapsing uncertainty, limitation, and failure into vague reassurance.
- Making broad changes when a narrow intervention is safer.
- Reporting a final status without a reproducible evidence trail.

## Handoff format

### Trigger
Why this skill was used.

### Inputs inspected
What was actually inspected.

### Procedure followed
Numbered notes mapped to the steps above.

### Evidence collected
Files, commands, screenshots, traces, or manual checks.

### Output or recommendation
Actionable result.

### Limitations
Anything incomplete, unverified, risky, or blocked.

### Final status
Use only one of: verified, partially verified, not verified, blocked.
